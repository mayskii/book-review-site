            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                It’s easy to write correct Ruby code, but to gain the fluency needed to write great Ruby code,
                you must go beyond syntax and absorb the Ruby way of thinking and problem solving.
                In <em>Eloquent Ruby</em>, Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do so you can leverage its immense, surprising power.
                Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers.
                He guides you to the “Ah Ha!” moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does,
                and how you can take advantage of this language’s elegance and expressiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                The book starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug.
                You’ll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#); why Ruby has so many control structures;
                how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for.
                It then moves to larger questions about methods and classes, operator overloading, and metaprogramming.
                The final chapters discuss advanced Ruby techniques, gems, and DSLs.

                <h4>Review #1: The first Ruby book I read in full within 24 hours</h4>
                <p>
                <strong>Reviewer:</strong> Peter Cooper<br>
                <strong>Date:</strong> February 26, 2011
                </p>

                <p>
                This book is so easy to read yet so useful and informative that I read it in its entirety within 24 hours.
                Eloquent Ruby is published by Addison Wesley and written by Russ Olsen (who also wrote *Design Patterns in Ruby*).
                It’s about 400 pages long with 31 short, focused chapters.
                </p>

                <p>
                Each chapter is titled as a guideline for writing “eloquent” Ruby — for example,
                “Create Classes That Understand Equality” or “Write Code That Looks Like Ruby”.
                Olsen’s writing is conversational and friendly, making the book engaging and far from dry.
                </p>

                <p>
                It’s free from major errors and is relevant to Ruby 1.9 but generally version-agnostic.
                I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to write idiomatic Ruby and understand Ruby culture better.
                </p>

                <h4>Review #2: Eloquent Olsen</h4>
                <p>
                <strong>Reviewer:</strong> Fogus<br>
                <strong>Date:</strong> March 7, 2011
                </p>

                <p>
                Having spent most of my career in Java, I found *Eloquent Ruby* refreshing and inspiring.
                Russ Olsen has a gift for making technical content engaging and even fun to read.
                His approach shows how Ruby’s elegant features often make traditional design patterns unnecessary.
                </p>

                <p>
                The book guides experienced developers new to Ruby toward understanding not just the syntax,
                but also the Ruby mindset — the culture of creating elegant, expressive, and robust code.
                </p>

                <p>
                The highlight is the final discussion of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs),
                showing how Ruby’s flexibility allows developers to mold the language itself
                to express solutions clearly and beautifully. Highly recommended!
